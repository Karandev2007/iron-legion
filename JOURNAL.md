Day 1 (30/7/25): (4h)
UPDATE 1
- did research on what should a soldering station have, i had some things in my mind that i wanted, as im moving into my personal space and i will do more projects, and build highway projects too so im building this.
- mostly sourced all components not doing fusionrack mistake here again ;/
- planned features are:
- helping hands with clips and fan and light, fan will be used as fume extractor
- modification on my solider iron - make it Plug Socket,

- to make it more simpler to print and easy to use and more DIY, i made drawers separate from main body:
